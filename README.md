In your first paragraph, introduce the problem that you were using data to solve.

In your second paragraph, summarize the steps that you took to solve the problem, as well as the challenges that you encountered along the way. This is an excellent spot to provide examples and descriptions of the code that you used.


In your final paragraph, share the results of your analysis and discuss the data that youâ€™ve generated. Have you identified any limitations to the analysis? What next steps would you recommend?

Be sure to include an image of the ERD you created when mapping out the database in your README.md.
